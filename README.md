# ATX-PSU-adpater
A small PCB and enclosure to re-use PC power supplies

Black: Ground
Green: 3.3V
Red: 5V
Yellow: 12V

The red LED indicates standby power (PSU is ready), the green LED is for power good. The PSU is running when the switch is low.
Two screw holes are placed under the enclosure.

There is no over-current protection on the PCB, it's as good as the PSU used with it.
